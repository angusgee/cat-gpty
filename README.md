# CatGpty

Cat Gippity is a Windows and Linux utility for improved proompting.

For optimum results from AI, it's best to give the model the entire context of your project, and use delimiters to help it parse the content.

## Problem statement

Copying all your project files' contents, delimiting manually, and pasting into ChatGPT or a similar API is time consuming.

Also, you won't know you're going to exceed the token limit until you do.

## Solution

CatGpty solves these issues for you.

Run the script from your project root folder and select the files to include.

Choose to add on a pre-proompt:

- Error checking
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Improvements to memory and time complexity
- Add comments and create documentation

The contents of your project are named and concatenated together, exported to a file and copied to your clipboard.

You can get the entire context of your project with only a couple of key presses.

Pro tip: iterate! Asking it to check again only takes a few more seconds and mitigates against innacurate results. Why not have it review your code for bugs, then check again for vulnerabilities?
