# CatGippity

CLI tool for improved proompting.

For optimum results from AI, it's best to give the model the entire context of your project, and use delimiters to help it parse the content.

## Problem statement

Copying all your project files' contents, delimiting manually, and pasting into Chat Gippity is time consuming.

Also, you won't know you're going to exceed the token limit until you do.

## Solution

CatGippity solves these issues for you.

Run the script from your project root folder and select the files to include.

Choose to add on a pre-proompt:

- Error checking
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Improvements to memory and time complexity
- Add comments and create documentation

The contents of your project are named and concatenated together, exported to a file and copied to your clipboard.

You can get the entire context of your project with only a couple of key presses
